                <p>Lakeside is the beautiful place of nepal located in pokhara metropolitan city.</p>

            <p>Pokhara is the second largest city in Nepal, after Kathmandu. The town is about 200 kilometres away from
                Kathmandu, to the west. It rests at the foot of the Annapurna range and is a favourite trekking starting
                point. The city of Pokhara can be divided in two - the charming Lakeside Pokhara, and the Old City. The
                Lakeside part offers many tourist attractions and beautiful views, while the Old City is the commercial
                hub of Pokhara. You can choose to stay in either location, although we recommend Lakeside. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="secondparagraph">
            <p>The Lakeside is further divided into the North and the Southside. Lakeside is named so, as it surrounds
                the Phewa Lake or the Phewa Tal, a gorgeous freshwater lake which is eerily similar to a mirror! The
                lake gained popularity for its breathtaking reflection of the blue skies and the towering Mt.
                Machhapuchhre of the Annapurna range.</p>
